# Otherside Command Center — Role-Relevant Extension: Proposal

> Status: **PROPOSAL — nothing here is built yet.** This maps how the role layer,
> operating/metrics split, gated commissions, and the refund/adjustment model fit
> onto the app that already exists. Where a Notion/Sheet change is needed, the
> exact additive schema is listed for you to verify **before** any code is written.

## 1. What exists today (so we extend, not rebuild)

- **Auth:** one shared site password (`DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`) → SHA-256 → httpOnly
  cookie, enforced in `middleware.ts`. **One role. Everyone sees every tab.**
- **Tabs:** Overview, Insights, Reborn Cash, Payments, Appointments, Applications,
  Sales Activity, Challenge, Reconciliation, Guide.
- **Data layer:** `/api/dashboard` pulls 4 Notion DBs + the Challenge Google Sheet,
  server-cached, into one `DashboardPayload`. Every tab reads from that one payload.
- **Drill-downs:** bars/cards → full underlying list (with search). **Preserve.**
- **No NPS tile and no referral tile exist today** — so "replace NPS with referral"
  is really "add a referral tile" (nothing to remove).
- Recent fixes this cycle: Sales money now reads correctly, cash date now reads
  "Payment Date", Outstanding removed, schema-health guard added.

**Design principle we're committing to (founder's words): "too much info is no
info."** Each role sees only its slice. Two lenses on the same data, kept distinct:
- **Operating lens** = *act* (who owes their next payment, who to chase).
- **Metrics lens** = *understand* (PIF vs plan vs open, close rates, adoption).

## 2. Architecture decision — roles as a *lens*, not new pages

The Notion "Testimonial Tracker" pattern = **one data layer, many role views.** We
mirror that exactly. We do **not** fork the data or duplicate tabs per person.

**Proposed:** a single **role selector** (driven by who's logged in — see §6) that
curates *which existing tabs and which cards within them* each role sees, and labels
each card **Operating** or **Metrics**. One payload, filtered presentation.

```
DashboardPayload (unchanged)
   └─ RoleView(role)  ← new, pure presentation layer
        ├─ tabs allowed for this role
        └─ per tab: cards allowed, tagged Operating | Metrics
```

Why this over alternatives:
- **vs. separate dashboards per role:** no data duplication, no drift, drill-downs
  keep working untouched. One source of truth.
- **vs. a giant permissions matrix in every component:** the role config lives in
  ONE file (`lib/roles.ts`), so adding Setter later is a config edit, not a refactor.

### Proposed Role → View matrix (draft — confirm/adjust)

| Role | Sees | Lens emphasis |
|---|---|---|
| **VA** (Jen/Rochelle) | Overview (curated), Appointments, Challenge (+ Telegram adoption), Payment-plan & Deposit **operating** lists | Operating first |
| **Closer** | Own close rate, own funnel, own commissions (gated), own booked/showed/offers/sales | Metrics + own commissions |
| **EM (Adeyemi)** | EM view = pipeline/enrollment ops (separate from his closer view) | Operating |
| **Ops** (2 people) | Reborn Cash operating (plans due, deposits owed, deferrals), Reconciliation, Data Health | Operating |
| **Oliver** | Everything (full) + commissions + adjustments rollups | Both |
| **Setter** (if added) | Setting activity: booked, show-rate on their sets | Metrics |

Plus the **Challenge → Role drill** the founder described: inside Challenge, a role
chip (e.g. "VA") that filters the Challenge view down to just that role's slice.

---

## 3. The refund / adjustment model (the important one)

**Problem today (three problems, one root cause):** the cash tracker logs *every
transaction as a new line*, so (a) revenue inflates as installments land, (b)
refunds were handled by *deleting rows* ("no bueno" — founder), and (c) plan-changes
(12k→10k, plan→PIF) leave a stale figure. All three are the same missing concept: a
**non-destructive record of change over time.**

### Recommended: a separate **Adjustments Ledger** (new Notion DB), NOT columns on the row

Original revenue & cash rows stay **100% intact**. Every change is a **separate,
dated, signed** entry that rolls up:

```
net revenue = Σ(original revenue)  + Σ(adjustment revenue Δ)
net cash    = Σ(original cash)      + Σ(adjustment cash Δ)
gross | refunded | net  ← all three shown, never overwritten
```

Proposed new DB **"Reborn Adjustments"** (additive — needs your OK on names):

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Client` | relation → Reborn Cash Tracker (or `Client Email` text) | who |
| `Type` | select: `Refund` · `Plan Change` · `Deferral` · `Comp` · `Correction` | what kind |
| `Revenue Delta` | number ($) — signed (e.g. −9000) | effect on booked revenue |
| `Cash Delta` | number ($) — signed (e.g. −4000) | effect on cash collected |
| `Date` | date | when it happened (drives dated rollups) |
| `Reason` | text | audit note |
| `Recorded By` | person | who processed it |

This one structure solves **refunds** (negative deltas on the refund date),
**plan-changes** (a `Plan Change` delta for the 2k difference), **deferrals**
(a `Deferral` entry; sale still counts for its launch, cash carries), and the
**"every transaction inflates revenue"** problem (net = originals + adjustments,
computed, never a hand-edited figure).

**Alternative considered (simpler, weaker):** refund columns *on the cash row*
(`Refunded?`, `Refund Revenue`, `Refund Cash`). Fine for a single refund, but it
can't hold a *history* (a plan-change **then** a later refund), can't be dated
independently, and re-introduces hand-editing the client line. **Not recommended**,
but it's a valid MVP if you want the smallest possible Notion change first.

> This ledger is the backbone the commissions and deposit/plan views also read from,
> so getting it right unlocks several outcomes at once.

## 4. Deposit / payment-plan / PIF tracking

Two lenses, same data:
- **Operating:** "who's on a plan and what's due" (name + next payment date + amount),
  "who paid a deposit and still owes", "who deferred". Actionable lists, drill-down.
- **Metrics:** of buyers — **% PIF vs % plan vs % open**, deposit conversion.
- **Filter:** PIF / Plan / Deposit / Deferred toggle across the list (Rochelle's ask).

Reads existing fields now (`Product`, `Payment Plan`, `Date of Next Payment`), and
gets **accurate** once the additive flags below exist.

---

## 5. Referral tile & Telegram adoption

- **Referral tile (replaces NPS intent):** *actual* referrals made, target **30%**.
  Needs a source of truth for "who referred": proposed additive `Referred By (email)`
  on the client record. Rate = distinct referrers ÷ clients. (No NPS score — measure
  what they *did*, not what they *said*.)
- **Telegram adoption:** attribution from inside Telegram is **impossible** (links in
  Telegram don't tie to email — only Kit emails tag). So we do **not** build on
  Telegram clicks. Instead: a **manual `Telegram Adopted` flag** in the Erupt sheet
  (+ optional `Telegram Username` for disambiguating same-name people, per Jen) → an
  **adoption-rate** metric card + an operating list of "not yet adopted → email them."

---

## 6. Commissions & access control (needs your decision)

Commission data must be **access-restricted to closers / Jen / Oliver**, and must
**react to refunds/changes** (a refund reverses/claws back its commission).

**A plain client-side password on a tab is not adequate** (founder agrees) — hiding a
tab still ships the numbers to the browser. So gate at the **API + route** layer.

Auth options (pick one — see the question at the end):

| Option | What it is | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **B. Per-user sessions + roles (recommended)** | Each person gets their own login; a signed httpOnly session carries their `role`; middleware + the dashboard API enforce it. No new external service. | Fits the existing cookie/middleware pattern; server-enforced; fast to ship; commissions never sent to non-finance roles | We manage a small user list (hashed pw + role), stored in env/Notion/KV |
| **C. Auth.js (NextAuth) credentials/Google** | Drop-in auth library, optional Google SSO | Battle-tested sessions, easy Google login later | Heavier dependency; more than we need today |
| **A. Second password on the commissions tab** | Prompt a 2nd password client-side | Trivial | **Rejected** — not real security, numbers still shipped |

**Recommendation: B now**, with a clean path to C if you later want Google SSO.
Commission is **computed in-dashboard** from `sale + rate rule + adjustments` (so a
refund auto-reverses it) rather than stored as a frozen number.

## 7. Exact properties each feature READS (verify names — trailing spaces are real)

**Reborn Cash Tracker** (`collection://367c…`): `Name`, `Email`, `Cash Collected`,
`Revenue`, `Balance`(formula), `Cohort`, `Product`, `Payment Plan`, `Payment Method`,
`Payment Date`, `Date of Next Payment`, `Coupon Code`, `Note`, **`Enr Manager `**
(trailing space).
**Appointments** (`368c…`): `Name`, `Email`, `Appointment Time`, `Appointment Status`,
`Appointment Type`, `Cohort`, **`Enr Manager `**, `Phone`, `Notes`, `Created`.
**Applications** (`33ec…`): `First Name`, `Last Name`, `Email`, `Phone`,
`Application Status`, `What is your current level of annual earnings in USD?`,
`Date Created`, **`Cohort `** (trailing space), `Enrollment Date`(rollup),
`Product`(rollup), `REBORN Payments Tracker`(relation).
**Sales Activity** (`04af…`): `Entry`, `Date`, **`Enr Manager`** (person, *no* trailing
space here), `Launch`, `New Calls in Calendar`, `Showed to Call`, `Offers Made`,
`Sales Made`, `Cash Collected on Call`, `Sales in Revenue`, `Paid in Full Sold`,
`Payment Plans Sold`, `No Show`, `Cancelled Calls`, `Rescheduled`.

### Proposed ADDITIVE changes (nothing until you confirm names)

- **New DB "Reborn Adjustments"** — §3 table.
- **Reborn Cash Tracker** additions: `Deposit Paid` (checkbox), `Program Deferral`
  (checkbox), `Referred By` (email/text).
- **Erupt Google Sheet** additions: `Telegram Adopted` (checkbox/TRUE-FALSE),
  `Telegram Username` (text).
- **Commissions**: prefer *computed* (rate rule + adjustments) over a stored column;
  if stored, a `Commission Rate` or `Commission Amount` + `Commission Status` on the
  client record — pending your rules.

---

## 8. Phased, additive build plan

- **Phase 0 — safe now, zero Notion changes:** role-lens scaffolding (`lib/roles.ts`
  + role selector), operating/metrics tagging on existing cards, **per-closer close
  rate at a glance** (data already correct after the Sales fix), PIF/plan/open
  metrics from existing fields (best-effort). Drill-downs preserved.
- **Phase 1 — after you verify schema:** Adjustments Ledger + gross/refunded/net
  rollups; deposit/deferral operating lists; Telegram adoption card + chase list;
  referral tile.
- **Phase 2 — after auth decision:** per-user role auth; **gated** commissions view
  (API-enforced) that reacts to adjustments.
- **Phase 3 — after Webflow output confirmed:** plan-amount parser tolerant of both
  the current Notion product strings and the new Webflow format.

## 9. Confirmations I need from you

1. **Auth approach** — B (per-user roles, recommended) / C (NextAuth) / other? And
   the user→role list (VA, Closer(s), EM, Ops×2, Oliver, Setter) + where to store it.
2. **Adjustments model** — approve the separate **Reborn Adjustments** ledger
   (recommended) vs. refund-columns-on-the-row MVP? Confirm the exact property names.
3. **Commission rules** — rate %, PIF vs plan handling, refund clawback behaviour, and
   **who sees what** (closers see *only their own* vs. all closers).
4. **Referral** — add `Referred By` to which DB, and the 30% denominator (challenge
   registrants? reborn clients?).
5. **Additive flags** — OK to add `Deposit Paid`, `Program Deferral` (Cash Tracker)
   and `Telegram Adopted`, `Telegram Username` (Erupt sheet)? Confirm names.
6. **Webflow** (Phase 3) — the confirmed product-name output once checkout moves, so
   the parser tolerates both formats.

**I can start Phase 0 immediately** (no Notion changes, fully reversible) while you
verify the schema for Phases 1–3.
